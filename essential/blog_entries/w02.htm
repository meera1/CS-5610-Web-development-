<h3>Week 2</h3>

<pre>
<p>
    <u><b>Things I did this week:</b></u>
    1) Created an experiment in JavaScript, made use of date; string functions and if-else loops
    2) Created an experiment such that the web page thus developed is a responsive one
    3) Created experiments in JQuery, learning the very basics
    4) Created experiments using JQuery events like slide, toggle and animation
</p>

<pre>
<p>
    <u><b>To-Do:</b></u>
    1) Think about ways to use JQuery in the Home Page
    2) Learn more about the JQuery so as to make use in the next experiments

    <u><b>Professor Jose's Advice:</b></u>

    1) Keep in mind that Professor wants all the web pages as responsive ones,
       and thus implement the future experiments accordingly

    2) In the JQuery experiments, suppose we have a selector as showm below:
    A]    <code>
        $("#p1").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
    </code>
    B]    <code>
        $("#p1")
        .css("color", "red")
        .slideUp(2000)
        .slideDown(2000);
    </code>
    As one can see, the code A is difficult to comprehend and thus time consuming as compared to
    the code B which a selector's actions each on a new line which makes it easier to read.
    Thus to make use of good coding practice in the future
