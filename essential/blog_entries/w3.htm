    1) I learnt Bootstrap. Learnt and implemented experiments using Bootstrap's HTML and
       CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables,
       navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins

    <u><b>Professor Jose's Advice:</b></u>
    1) Professor suggested that the JavaScript files used in experiments be stored in seperate .js file and import them in the
    experiments; i.e. use external style sheets as that styling would then be available to any other experiment for use also,
    thus keep in mind while implementing future experiments

    2) There should not be use of any styling when one is using bootstrap

    3) Keep the CSS and JS files in seperate directories named CSS and JS respectively as Professor taught in class
