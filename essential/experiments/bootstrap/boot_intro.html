        <h2>Short Stroy about Belief</h2>
        <p> <pre>
            One businessman was in debt and couldn’t figure out a way out of it. Creditors were pressing him. Suppliers were demanding for a payment. He was sitting on a bench in the park with his head down, thinking what could save the company from bankruptcy. Suddenly, an old man appeared in front of him.

            -	I see that something is bothering you, - he said.

            After listening to the businessman, the old man said:

            -	I think I can help you.

            He asked the businessman, what his name was, wrote him a check and was shoving it into his hands saying:

            -	Take this money. We will meet here exactly in one year, and you will be able to return it to me at that time.

            After that, he turned around and disappeared just as suddenly as he appeared.

            The businessman saw a check in his hands for an amount of 500 thousand dollars, signed by John Rockefeller, one of the richest people in the world at that time!

            ‘I could end all of my problems in no time!’ – He thought. But instead, the businessman decided to put the check into his safe. Only one thought about his existence gave him strength to find a solution to save his business.

            With the return of his optimism, he concluded profitable deals. He was able to commit a few big deals. During a couple of months he got out of debt and started to earn money again.

            Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the same check. At the agreed time the old man appeared again. And at the moment, when the businessman wanted to return the check and to share his story of success, a nurse ran up and grabbed the old man.

            -	I’m so glad, I caught him! - She exclaimed. – I hope he wasn’t bothering you. He always runs away from the house and tells he is John Rockefeller.

            Surprised, the businessman was standing there bemused. During the whole year he was spinning and building a business, buying and selling, convinced that he had half a million dollars. Suddenly he understood that it’s not the money, real or imaginary, that turned his life up. It was his new confidence that gave him strength, to achieve everything that he had now.

In this experiment, I have used bootstrap. 
    What is Bootstrap?
    Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
    Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
    Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs

    I have used some basic bootstrap classes like col-lg, col-md, col-sm, col-xs for the columns described by the following code:

    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-xs-2" &gt;
         left
                &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-xs-8" &gt;
         main
                &lt;/div &gt;
        &lt;div class="col-xs-2" &gt;
         right
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    Also, I used classes container, jumbotron, forms and navbar.
