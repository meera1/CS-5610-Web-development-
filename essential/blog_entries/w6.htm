<pre>
<p>
<u><b>Things I did this week:</b></u>
    1) Learnt NodeJS basics and implemented the experiments using Angular JS
    2) My final project would require web-scraping so I used NodeJS and learnt how to scrape 
       web pages in the experients
</p>

<p>
<u><b>To-Do:</b></u>
    1) Learn more about scraping web pages by ignoring the Ads that populate the page, which makes it 
       more difficult of a task
    2) Learn how to host my application on OpenShift
