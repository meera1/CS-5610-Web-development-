    In this experiment, I downloaded the angular-route library for 
    carrying out the routing process and thus this experiment is based 
    on routing. It is basic routing wherein I understood the functioning 
    of routing. Splitting a single page with many functionalities with many pages
    with each functionality. Thus the main page will request for the other pages 
    and what the controller will do is load that content in the main page 
    thus we will remain in the same page even though other pages were requested. 
    This is the basic idea behind single page applications.

    <h2>Errors</h2>
    <p class="p4">

        Errors:
        Also I encountered an error "Error: 404 Not Found"
        The structure of the files was that I have a folder named 'angular' within it
        there is a folder 'partials' and within that there were the partial navigation bar 
        links pages. eg. ron.html So giving the link'partial/ron.html' did not work
        because in routing we never load another page, the controller fetches all the 
        contents of that specified page and displays it in the main page controlled by the controller. 
        Thus the link of the image required by the page under partials folder needs to be in the 
        'angular' folder
