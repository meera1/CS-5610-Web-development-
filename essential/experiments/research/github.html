        In this experiment we will learn some basics about Git.
        <h3>
            What is Git?
        </h3>
        <p class="p4">
            <pre class="p4">
                    It is a free open sourse distributed version control system designed to host 
                    small to large projects with speed and efficiency</pre>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Git Workflow
        </h3>
        <p class="p4">
            <pre class="p4">
                     The basic Git workflow is:
                        You modify files in your working directory.
                        You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
                        You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
           
                     I had the basic knowledge about github setup, creating a repo, add and commits, pushing changes. But my aim in doing 
                     this experiment is to learn more about branching, update and merge. So let's start
    </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Branching
        </h3>
        <p class="p4">
            <pre class="p4">
                        Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the "default" branch 
                        when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.

                        create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using
                            <b><u>git checkout -b feature_x</u></b>

                        switch back to master
                            <b><u> git checkout master</u></b>

                        and delete the branch again
                            <b><u>git checkout mastergit branch -d feature_x</u></b>

                        a branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your remote repository
                            <b><u>git push origin &lt;branch&gt;</u></b>
                    </pre>
        </p>
        <img src="/experiments/scraping/images/git1.png" />

        <h3>
            Update and Merge
        </h3>
        <p class="p4">
            <pre class="p4">
                        to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute 
                            <b><u>git pull</u></b>
                        in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.
                        to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use

                            <b><u>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</u></b>

                        in both cases git tries to auto-merge changes.
                        Unfortunately, this is not always possible and results in conflicts. 
                        You are responsible to merge those conflicts manually by editing the files shown by git.
                        After changing, you need to mark them as merged with

                            <b><u>git add &lt;filename&gt;</u></b>
                        before merging changes, you can also preview them by using

                            <b><u>git diff &lt;source_branch&gt; &lt;target_branch&gt;</u></b>
                    </pre>
        </p>
