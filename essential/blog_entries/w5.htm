<h3>Week 5 (Most amazing week till now!!!)</h3>

<pre>
<p>
<u><b>Things I did this week:</b></u>
    1) Learnt AngularJS, a JS framework which works similar to the MVC framework
    2) Implemented CRUD operations using the new learnt technology. The most amazing 
       week for me in this course. I found it flabbergasting to SEE a MVC framework work locally
       just by writing some simple piece of code
    3) After the basics, I worte some angular routing experiments that gave the ability to my program 
       to develop single page applications (The second reason for this week to be an amazing one ;) )
    4) Also learnt about minification from Professor and the logic about how the code works even after 
       minificaiton but did not implement it
</p>

<pre>
    <u><b>Professor Jose's Advice:</b></u>
    1) AngularJS is a powerful JS framework and thus can and must be used in wide range of applications
